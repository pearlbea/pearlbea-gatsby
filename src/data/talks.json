    "title": "How Do Service Workers Even?",
    "date": "November 2nd, 2018",
    "description": "Magic! But seriously, how do they work? Service workers do a lot of great stuff: cache files for offline, make your site faster, enable push notifications, and so much more. Service workers are the future of modern web applications but they can be difficult to work with. We'll guide you through the inner workings of these background JavaScript threads and show you how to avoid some common pitfalls. We'll also show how Google's open source Workbox library gives you the tools to build real world applications and manage the service worker lifecycle with ease.",

    "description": "The Bendy Game of Life is a 3D version of Conway’s Game of Life, which simulates the evolution of a population given initial settings chosen by the player. Visually, the game board is a 3D grid with a variable number of cells filled in or 'alive.' Depending on the number of 'alive' or 'dead' neighbor cells each cell has, it will die, survive, or come alive in the next turn or 'generation.' Generations continue following this algorithm until the population stabilizes.",
